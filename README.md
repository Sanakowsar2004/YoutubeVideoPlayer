Creating a simple YouTube video player using only HTML can be done by embedding the video using the <iframe> element. This method allows you to display a YouTube video on your webpage with minimal effort.
Explanation:
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines the document type and version of HTML.
The <html> tag is the root element of an HTML page.
The <head> section contains meta-information about the HTML document, such as the character set and title.
The <body> section contains the content of the HTML document.
The <h1> tag is used for the main heading.
The <div> tag is used to center the video on the page.
The <iframe> element is used to embed another HTML page within the current page. In this case, it is used to embed a YouTube video.
Attributes of <iframe>:
width and height: Specifies the width and height of the embedded video.
src: The URL of the page to embed. For a YouTube video, this is in the format https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID.
frameborder: Specifies whether or not to display a border around the <iframe>.
allow: Specifies a list of features the iframe is allowed to use.
allowfullscreen: Allows the video to be played in fullscreen mode.
